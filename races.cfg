        description= _ "Snow fairies have haunted the highlands of Wesnoth for centuries, preferring to stay in only the coldest and most inaccessible places. Unlike most elves, they love the fragile beauty of the high mountain flowers and the soft multi-colored palette of the heather, rather than the lush green forests preferred by their lowland brethren. They even appreciate the delicate forms of the underground mushrooms that are normally only seen by dwarves and trolls.
Snow fairies are powerful, ethereal, and elusive; even dwarvish wardens and the highest-flying drakes rarely encounter them. They harness the elemental power of the mountains to work their magic, suddenly animating the wiry highland plants to entangle an unsuspecting target, or assailing their foes with a magically-created cold flash of arctic purity."

Then somewhen happened a rebellion, the drakes fought hard but in the end got defeated and overthrown by the Saurians they ruled over, the surviving few have had their wings mutilated and their bodies cursed to never breathe fire again. In shame and disgust they fled into the depths of the jungle, where they have craven a new way of life through tooth and nail, despite all odds they survived.

Salamanders stride through the jungle in small nomadic communities, one oddity about them is that they come in variations that have different qualities and dont have control over what variant would hatch from an egg. This fact and the brutal nature of their nomadic existence causes the variants that have got hatched in excessive amounts to get singled out and sold to the Saurians. The Saurians accept such trade with Salamanders and even tolerate them within a tribe despite the supposed enmity between them, as how the jungle tribes gained their freedom became legend it must have passed an millenia, perhaps.

The green variant is adept in the forests, the blue variant has adapted to aquatic environments and the black one excels in the dark of the night."

Only a few have found a safe place - either in manmade objects, such as lamps, swords or jewelry, or in men that agreed to host a djinn in their mortal body. United they form the mighty half-djinns that are both man and djinn. In the land of the deserts, half-djinns are not seen as bastards, in fact, they are respected throughout the lands, as their union symbolises the great bond between man and djinn that brought forth many good things to the life of both kin.

    description= _ "Geography
The Vilkai are humans who live in the northern regions of Wesnoth. Their homeland are the snow-covered woods in the valleys of the Heart Mountains. They originate from the Green Isle and migrated to Wesnoth under the leadership of prince Haldric. Many people suffered from the onslaughts of orcs throughout year 2 YW and some were forced to flee. Along with them went Denvan with wife and child, and all the other inhabitants of his village. Moving northwest, they reached the Heart Mountains. Although those barren valleys had not particularlymuch to offer, their remoteness promised peace and safety from the violent turmoil, thus the homeless refugees settled in the area.

Way of life and society

Due to an isolated live in cold and harsh environments, the Vilkai developed a natural resistance to cold, and the rather sparse number of huntable animals in these lands turned them into excellent hunters.However, they are not the only ones who go deerstalking, the competition is extensive, because predators such as bears, boars and wolves are also to be found in those woods. While they steer clear of bears and feral pigs (unless the need of food makes it unavoidable), the same cannot be said of wolves. Over the centuries, a strong relationship evolved between this nordic folk and wolves packs. The very few other peoples who have knowledge of the presence of the Vilkai shed the rumor that wolfblood is flowing through their veins. At some point in the past a tribe of shamans began to call them 'Vilkai', a name which in their language means simply 'wolves' – and that's how these inhabitants of the mountains got their name. Vilkai, who distinguish themselves on their hunter's prey, the number of slain bears and other dangerous beasts, are considered 'superiors', but they established no clearly defined hierarchy. Children become early involved in day to day work, barely 4 years old they help the women collecting wood, picking berries and searching for wild herbs. Starting at the age of 8, they learn to handle weapons, aged 14 the boys are taken on their first hunting tour. While growing up they gain profound insight into the daily routine and activities of their people.

Characteristics

Perhaps there were times when mages lived with them – if so, they are long gone. The woodlands and hilly areas offer a variety of curing herbs and plants with healing power, and one or the other Vilkai studies their effects and is capable to deal with alleviation of diseases and cure of serious injuries. Those with a passion for the healing arts are highly respected by their fellow men."
