    description= _ "The common conception of a knight is of a well-armored warrior with a bright sword and a keen lance, but some knights diverge from this description. They use a morning star flail instead of a sword, and carry a heavy lance that can skewer an orc in a single blow, and will stagger even a troll or an ogre.
‘Sir Jil’ has served Baron Baldres faithfully for years, and she is entirely loyal to him; he is one of the few men in Wesnoth capable of shielding her from the many people who have sworn vengeance against her. For his part, Baldres has found Jil to be a highly effective lieutenant. She is one of his deadliest fighters, she never stays bribed, and she will cheerfully resort to any underhanded tactic if she faces a challenge to her authority that can’t be smashed down by main strength."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CHARGE}
