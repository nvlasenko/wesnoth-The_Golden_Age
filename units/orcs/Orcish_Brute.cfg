    description= _ "Savage and warlike, Southern Orcs form the backbone of the invading hordes. Rather than the heavy swords favored by their northern brethren, the less well-equipped southern orcs tend to use cheaper clubs, and they press their attack with a flurry of blows rather than the slower but more damaging sword-strokes used by the northerners.
Orcish society is not particularly well-suited to large-scale warfare, and the smaller tribes sometimes fall prey to better-organized forces, but their warlords learn quickly and in recent years have even started using their enemiesâ€™ tactics against them. One thing is sure: whenever the barbarian hordes come screaming for blood, there will always be orcish warriors leading the charge."
